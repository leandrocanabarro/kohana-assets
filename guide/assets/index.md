[repository](http://www.github.com/alxlit/kohana-assets).

## What does it do?

It automatically compiles CSS and JavaScript assets (minifying and combining
sources), and can be extended to add a compilation step for other types of 
assets.

## Features

  - CSS and JavaScript minification
  - [Less](http://leafo.net/lessphp/) support built in
  - [CoffeeScript](http://github.com/alxlit/coffeescript-php) support eventually
  - Efficient; assets are compiled once, cached, and served directly
  - Multiple source files into a single asset
  - Easy extensibility
